Overview

This is my attempts on Kaggle platform.

Files
=====
All the files related to a competition on Kaggle are placed in a folder named after that competition.

Within each folder, typically there are subfolders like 
	data\
	tutorials\
	submission\
	results\
These folders are easy to understand.

London_Scikit-learn
===================
This is a get-started competition, with very basic dataset.

I tried the following methods:

	Basic + SVM
	PCA + SVM
	Sparse-filtering + SVM

The performance of PCA + SVM is the best so far.

----------------
The method of sparse-filtering comes from a [Stanford paper] [1], and an elegant sk-learn style [implementation] [2] by dolaameng@github
